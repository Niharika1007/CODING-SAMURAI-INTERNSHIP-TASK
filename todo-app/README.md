# 📝 My Personalized To-Do List App

Welcome to **My To-Do List App**, a minimal yet powerful React-based application designed to help you stay productive and organized — every task, every day.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to:
- ✨ Add new tasks to their daily list  
- 📝 Edit tasks with ease  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Delete tasks when no longer needed

Built as a passion project to sharpen my **React fundamentals**, this app integrates form handling, component state, and basic **CRUD operations** all in one neat UI.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As a developer constantly juggling projects, learning goals, and tasks — I realized that building a **to-do list** is a perfect hands-on way to:
- Master component-level state in React
- Practice dynamic rendering and input handling
- Embrace the concept of "Reactivity" in React

It’s more than a checklist app. It’s a **learning canvas**.
